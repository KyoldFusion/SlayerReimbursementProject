# Slayer Reimbursement System

## Project Description

The Slayer Reimbursement System is will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can log in and submit requests for reimbursements and view their past tickets and pending requests. Managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursements.

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Sessions to track the user who is logged in passed to the back-end.
* Clean minimal UI for users for easy navigation and appeal of website aesthetic.
* Statistics for managers using chart.js along with table data.

To-do list:

- Required Tools/Services to begin working on the project via google

Git: We'll be using Git as a version control tool during the course of this program. Not only will you use Git to track changes to your projects, but you'll also use it to collaborate with your trainer and with your fellow associates.

PostgreSQL 10 (Optional): PostgreSQL is an open source relational database. We will leverage this technology in order to persist and organize data. Though you are expected to use AWS' Relational Database Service to host your database for projects in their production environments, you are welcome to download Postgres to your local host while working with your application in a development environment.

Once your database is setup using localhost create your tables using

```
CREATE TABLE valorant_employees (
	employee_id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name varchar  not null,
	last_name varchar  not null,
	tiers varchar not null,
	employee_password varchar  not null,
	employee_username varchar  not null,
	email varchar  not null,
	isManager varchar 
)

CREATE TABLE valorant_reimbursements(
	reimbursement_id bigserial,
	agent_id int,
	economy money not null,
	purpose varchar not null,
	transaction_time timestamp DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	status varchar DEFAULT 'pending',
	manager_id int,
	approval_reason varchar DEFAULT 'none',
	primary key (reimbursement_id),
	foreign key (agent_id)
	REFERENCES valorant_employees(employee_id)
)

INSERT INTO valorant_employees (first_name, last_name, tiers, employee_password, employee_username, email, isManager) 
VALUES ('phoenix', 'fire', 'radiant', 'gutted', 'hotboy', 'hotboy@gmail.com', '1')

INSERT INTO valorant_reimbursements (reimbursement_id, agent_id, economy, purpose, transaction_time, 
        status, manager_id, approval_reason) 
        VALUES (default, 1, 2500, 'weapons', default, default, 1, default)


```

Python: We will be using Python 3 as one of our primary languages for the duration of the program. This Python installation will provide the standard library, preferred installer program, and several other components that make building and running Python applications possible.

Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

PostgreSQL ODBC Driver: When building Python applications, we will utilize pyodbc, a PyPI module that makes accessing ODBC databases easy. As such, you'll need to download and configure a Postgres-specific ODBC driver.

Link: https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/

PyCharm: We will be using PyCharm as our integrated development environment for Python. Again, an IDE is not required, but it is useful for rapid development.

## System variable Setup
If you are using System environment variables the following link is how to set up your variables for access in the code after downloading 			drivers: <br> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEroNNzqlF4

System variables used:
	db_url <br>
	db_username <br>
	db_password <br>
	db_name
	
## Usage

## StartUp

Once you have cloned the repository and setup all the required tools, open the "main.py" file as it should be configured in flask already and click the green run button in Jetbrains(Pycharm) in the top right.

## Login Page 

After pressing the play button the program should connect you over to the login page where you will have to login with the credentials of a user you created on your local database. 

![Login Page](/RembursementProject1/ReadMeImg/LoginPAGE.PNG)

## Index Page

Afterwards you should be able to access the index(home) page where you will see your navigation of all the options under an employee (Submit Requests, Requests,and Home) These are your primary navigators with the log out button under the notification symbol in the top right

![Index Page](/RembursementProject1/ReadMeImg/IndexP.PNG)

## Submit Requests Page

To submitting reimbursements as long as you have established your tables via create statements you should fill out the forms stating the price to be reimbursed along with the the manager it should follow to and the reason behind your submission.

![Submit Request Page](/RembursementProject1/ReadMeImg/REIMPage.PNG)

## Requests Page

After a reimburement is submitted on the submit reimbursement tab, you can check the request under the requests tab and see the status of all of your pending/approved/denied reimbursements submitted. If you log in as a manager you should be able to check all of the request submitted on the same tab (requests) and have the ability to approve/deny/re-open any requests you have created.

## Statistics Page

If you are a manager you will have access to the statistics tab where you will be able to see the statistics regarding members who submitted reimbursements and look at a graph depiction or direct table for information.
